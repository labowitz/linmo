## Table Of Contents

This documentation provides a guide for using **Lineage Motif Analysis**, a computational tool which analyzes a set of lineage trees to identify patterns of correlated cell fates that represent building blocks of larger developmental programs. This walk-through consists tutorials, which showcase LMA applied to various lineage tree datasets, and the API.
