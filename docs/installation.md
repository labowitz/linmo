## Setting up a conda environment

To avoid dependency conflicts, we recommend the use of a dedicated [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) environment. To do so, enter the following in terminal.

```
conda create -n linmo
source activate linmo
```

## Installation

Installation with PyPI using pip can be done by entering the following in terminal.

```
pip install linmo
```

Alternatively, install the `linmo ` package directly from GitHub by entering the following in terminal.

```
python -m pip install 'https://github.com/tranmartin45/linmo.git'
```
